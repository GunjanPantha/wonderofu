How to Play
Starting the Game

    You wake up in a dark forest

    Type commands to interact with the environment

    Be creative - obvious escape attempts will be thwarted!

Example Commands

DON'T try these (the AI will oppose them):

    "find the exit"

    "escape the forest"

    "walk home"

    "call for rescue"

DO try creative approaches:

    "thank the forest for its beauty"

    "ask the forest what it wants"

    "embrace being lost"

    "sing to the trees"

    "plant a seed"

    "apologize for intruding"

Game Features

    Dynamic AI Responses: Every playthrough is unique

    Inventory System: Find and use items (but they may break!)

    Escalating Difficulty: The more you resist, the stronger the forest becomes

    Multiple Endings: Victory through creativity or defeat through stubbornness

Victory Tips

    Avoid Direct Approaches: The forest expects you to try to escape

    Be Unexpected: Try philosophical, emotional, or meta approaches

    Show Respect: The forest may respond to humility and appreciation

    Think Laterally: Sometimes the best way out is through acceptance

    Use Multiple Creative Attempts: One creative solution may not be enough

Troubleshooting
AI Not Working

    Check your Mistral API key in .env

    Verify internet connection

    The game will use fallback responses if AI fails

Django Issues

    Make sure you have Python 3.8+

    Try: python manage.py migrate (if needed)

    Check that all dependencies are installed

Game Philosophy

This game is about lateral thinking and creativity over brute force. The AI will actively work against obvious solutions, forcing you to think like the protagonist in a psychological thriller. Victory comes through wit, not persistence.

Remember: The forest has a will of its own, and it doesn't want you to leave. Your creativity is your only weapon against its malevolent influence.

Good luck, and may your imagination set you free!
